# Idea

React Portfolio Website - Build & Deploy React JS Portfolio Website.
In this React js project, I'm going to step-by-step create and deploy a fully responsive personal portfolio website from scratch! By the end of this Project, I will gain the experience of how to create a React App from scratch, how to use the React Icons Library in my React projects, how to use React useState hooks, how to build modern website designs with CSS3, how to use SwiperJS (to create carousels/slides) in my React projects, how to add multiple contact options on my website (WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Direct form submission using EmailJS), and planning on way more stuff!

## How I worked on this project

My goal was to simulate a professional work enviroment.
[Portfolio React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- I built this app based on Figma UI/UX designs
- I worked with tasks on a Kanban board
- I used feature branches and Pull Requests
## How to navigate this project

- Somewhat complex stateful logic
- Responsive CSS using styled-components
- Will integrate tests using React Testing Library
​
## Why i built the project this way
​
- I didn't use a state management library like Redux on purpose. For this app simple `useState` is sufficient. I realized that more and more projects don't use Redux anymore since GraphQL or react-query are often used for data management.

- styled-components is a great library for styling. It includes an auto-prefixer, uses scoped classes and allows a seamless integration with JS.

- My plan is to become a Full-Stack Developer eventually. But at the moment I focus on the FrontEnd. Also I have basic BackEnd knowledge as well and working my way up to Full-Stack :)

- Testing is an essential part of production applications. Testing Library is the go-to library in the React community. I will cover the essential features of the app with tests.

## If I had more time I would change this

- Refactor some of the code.
- Probably Use Redux for State Management.
- Learn and Implement TypeScript into the Project.
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
